               The Kelly School not only teaches kids the fundamental skills for
                living/life after school but also enriches their lives with

                    <p>Kerri’s helped children surpass their self-imposed ceilings for over 35 years. She holds numerous K-12 teaching certifications, a bachelor’s in education, and a master’s in theological studies.

                <p>God calls us to do things we can’t do, so we have to rely on Him. I prayed, “Lord, where do you want to lead me? How do you want to grow my faith?”  God said, “Start a school.”  I wept. My passion has always been kids & education. So in a sense, it wasn’t anything new, just a HUGE release. (In fact, I secretly went for my masters in hopes of such a thing; I just hadn’t told anybody.) Ephesians 2:10: ”For we are God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God planned beforehand so that we would walk in them.” This is my prayer for every teacher, every volunteer, and every student at The Kelly School: that they would know why they are here and live to fulfill their God given destiny.</p>
                <p>The name: Everyone asks, “Why ‘The Kelly School’?” I named the school after my parents, Tom and Bev Kelly. They taught me everything I know. They taught me to love God, rely on Him, love kids, and teach kids. They are my heroes.</p>
                <p>The Kelly School started informally in 2014 with just one student. In 2016 The Kelly School became a DBA with eight students. In 2017 The Kelly School grew to fifteen students and became an incorporated private school recognized by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Currently about 70 students attend.</p>
