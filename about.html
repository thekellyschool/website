                   Kids with all abilities come together in an environment
                 tailored to teach and learn in a way specific to each kid.
               The Kelly School not only teaches kids the fundamental skills for
                living/life after school but also enriches their lives with
              moral and Biblical principles.  I do not know where we would be

                    <p>When Kerri meets a student, she sees untapped potential. Kerri takes a 9th grader who can’t read nearly to grade level in a couple years, and the 10th grader with math talent to college level. </p>
                    <p>But grade-level isn’t the metric, personal motivation is. Self-propulsion and personal responsibility become a way of life for students. Students learn to recognize whether they’re doing their best or just what’s comfortable in every area, from spelling to encouraging others. </p>
                    <p>Kerri’s helped children surpass their self-imposed ceilings for over 35 years. She holds numerous K-12 teaching certifications, a bachelor’s in education, and a master’s in theological studies. In addition to directing the school, Kerri teaches 6-12th grades.</p>

                    <p>Bethany lights up the room and her students. They genuinely miss her when she’s not there and feel safe talking to her about their emotions and struggles. Bethany has volunteered with kids her whole life, including volunteering at Cornerstone Ministries and now serving as youth leader at DOVE Christian Fellowship Elizabethtown.</p>

                <p>God calls us to do things we can’t do, so we have to rely on Him. I prayed, “Lord, where do you want to lead me? How do you want to grow my faith?”  God said, “Start a school.”  I wept. My passion has always been kids & education. So in a sense, it wasn’t anything new, just a HUGE release. (In fact, I secretly went for my masters in hopes of such a thing; I just hadn’t told anybody.) Ephesians 2:10: ”For we are God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God planned beforehand so that we would walk in them.” This is my prayer for every teacher, every volunteer, and every student at The Kelly School: that they would know why they are here and live to fulfill their God given destiny.</p>
                <p>The name: Everyone asks, “Why ‘The Kelly School’?” I named the school after my parents, Tom and Bev Kelly. They taught me everything I know. They taught me to love God, rely on Him, love kids, and teach kids. They are my heroes.</p>
                <p>The Kelly School started informally in 2014 with just one student. In 2016 The Kelly School became a DBA with eight students. In 2017 The Kelly School grew to fifteen students and became an incorporated private school recognized by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.</p>

          <p>The Kelly School does not discriminate on the basis of color, nationality, ethnic origin, or socio-economic factors. While students and families are not required to hold to the same belief in God, all subjects will be taught from a biblical worldview. Students and parents must acknowledge this. Respect of one another is required.</p>
